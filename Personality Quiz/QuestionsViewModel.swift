//Document class, functions, variables

//mutability and things referencing it
//When mutating, struct use different ones where class doesn't

//TODOs:
// - Implement scroll view on QuestionsViewController (new branch)
//    - Multiline labels in a stack view in a scroll view
//    - Make an article with findings
//   - Not use storyboard and programatically build your view (eg if you have different number of answers) diff
